# Adaptive-Normalization
Fully working keras based regression prediction model using adaptive normalization technique.
Adaptive normalization is technique, where machine learns to normalize data during inference.
Here adaptive technique taking Z-Score normalization and Min-Max normalization as base is compared with their respective traditional methods.
